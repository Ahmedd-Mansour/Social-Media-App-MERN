# Social-Media-App-MERN
simple social media MERN application that enables users to log in and securely manage authorizations through JWT (JSON Web Tokens). I created and managed a MongoDB database to handle user accounts and their posts.
Every user has the ability to produce and publish posts, which are displayed on their personal profile.
